# Pos Buddy

The PosBuddy system is a cash register software for clubs and small to medium-sized events.


The software replaces classic bon systems with a solution consisting of 
a server based on Rasperry Pi and smartphones at 1..n payment stations.


Customers pay by scanning a hardware token that they have previously topped up at a payment station
